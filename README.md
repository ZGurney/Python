This is where I upload all of my finished python programs. You might think they are a bit basic but I'm still a beginner. Please feel free to mess around with them; email me at pinpan@taprevu.tk if you've created something interesting! 

I am currently using a Mac setup with Python 2.7. I edit my documents with PyCharm, an excellent python editor. Visit my website [here](https://www.taprevu.blogspot.com "TapRevu").
