This is where I upload all of my finished python programs. It is an extremely *easy-to-learn* language for beginner programmers. Try it out on your computer (if you have a mac) by opening up the terminal app and typing in '*python*'. You might think the programs are a bit basic but I'm still a beginner. Please feel free to mess around with them; email me at pinpan@taprevu.tk if you've created something interesting!
